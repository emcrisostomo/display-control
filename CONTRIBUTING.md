Git Flow
--------

I chose to use the [Git flow branching model][flow] for this project, so you are
kindly required to follow the same model when making your contributions.  That
basically means that:

  * If you are fixing a bug, you can create a *hotfix* branch from the affected
  release (preferably, the latest one) and send a pull request from that branch.
  * If you are creating a new feature, please checkout the `develop` branch and
  send a pull request from there.
  * I won't consider pull request coming from the `master` branch and if I do, I
    won't be quick.

Coding Conventions and Style
----------------------------

The C and C++ code uses `snake_case` and is formatted using NetBeans with a
customized [Allman (BSD)][allman] style.  See [`README.codestyle`][codestyle]
