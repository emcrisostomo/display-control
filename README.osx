Introduction
============

This file describes the steps required to build this bundle on a supported Apple
OS X system.  A complete C/C++ toolchain for OS X is provided with Apple XCode,
which can be freely installed from the Apple App Store.  See README for more
information about the tested configurations.

XCode
=====

If you plan to build the bundle with CLang/LLVM, the easiest way to get a
working toolchain is installing Apple XCode.  Apple XCode ships with both the
CLang/LLVM and the GCC compiler.

XCode, however, does not install some required command line tools by default.
To install them, the following operations must be performed:

  1. Choose the "XCode/Preferences..." menu item.

  2. Navigate to the "Downloads" pane.

  3. Select the "Components" tab.

  4. Select the "Command Line Tools" item and press the "Install" button.

GNU Build System
================

The GNU Build System is required only by developers willing to modify the code
on a OS X machine.  Regular users only willing to install display-control do not
need the GNU Build System.

Recent XCode Command Line Tools releases are not shipping all the components of
the GNU Build System any longer.  OS X users are thus required to build an
alternate GNU Build System on their system.

The required source bundles can be downloaded from their official web pages:

  1. Autoconf:

     (http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/) (>= v. 2.69)

  2. Automake

     (http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/) (>= v. 1.14.1)

  3. Libtool:

     (http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/)  (>= v. 2.4.2)

Libtool is not required to build this package but it's a core component of the
GNU Build System.

XCode Command Line Tools still ships GNU M4 (v. 1.4.6).

To avoid conflicts with the binaries installed by XCode, it is strongly
suggested to install the GNU Build System in an alternate location (such as the
default /usr/local/bin) or in a private user folder.  To choose the desired
install location, use the --prefix configure option.

For further instruction on building the GNU Build System from scratch, please
check the README.gnu-build-system file.

Localization and gettext
========================

display-control is localizable and locale support requires GNU gettext to be
available at build time.  OS X does not ship gettext you will need to build it
yourself or use a package manager such as MacPorts or Homebrew to install it.

Depending on gettext installation path, configure may not be able to find
<libintl.h> or libintl.  In this case, you will need to instruct configure about
their location (this example assumes you use MacPorts' default installation path
/opt/local):

  $ CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include" LDFLAGS="-L/opt/local/lib" ./configure

If configure detects that gettext is available, you will find a message such as:

  checking whether to use NLS... yes

or, which is equivalent, config.h will contain the following definition:

  #define ENABLE_NLS 1
